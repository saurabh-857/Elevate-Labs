### Report on Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

#### Objective
The task aimed to learn how to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions using any web browser (Chrome, Firefox) and to document the process, including a list of suspicious extensions found and removed (if any).

#### Steps Taken (Following Hints/Mini Guide)
1. **Opened Browser’s Extension/Add-ons Manager**  
   - In Chrome: Navigated to `chrome://extensions/` via the address bar.  
   - In Firefox: Went to `about:addons` or accessed through the menu (Menu > Add-ons and Themes).  

2. **Reviewed All Installed Extensions**  
   - Checked the list of extensions for any unfamiliar or unnecessary ones.  

3. **Checked Permissions and Reviews**  
   - Examined permissions requested by each extension (e.g., access to all website data, browsing history).  
   - Looked up reviews on the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site for any red flags like poor ratings or user complaints about privacy issues.  

4. **Identified Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions**  
   - Noted extensions with excessive permissions (e.g., access to all data on all websites without a clear purpose).  
   - Flagged extensions with no clear functionality or those not actively used.  

5. **Removed Suspicious Extensions**  
   - In Chrome: Clicked "Remove" on the extension card.  
   - In Firefox: Selected "Remove" next to the extension in the Add-ons Manager.  

6. **Restarted Browser and Checked Performance**  
   - Restarted the browser to ensure no lingering effects.  
   - Noted any improvements in speed or functionality post-removal.  

7. **Researched Malicious Extensions’ Impact**  
   - Investigated how malicious extensions can harm users (e.g., data theft, injecting ads, redirecting searches).  

8. **Documented Steps and Extensions Removed**  
   - Recorded the process and findings (see Deliverable below).  

#### Deliverable: List of Suspicious Extensions Found and Removed
- **No suspicious extensions were identified during this process.**  
   - All installed extensions (e.g., Grammarly, AdBlock, LastPass) were recognized, actively used, and had reasonable permissions with positive reviews.  
   - No removals were necessary.  

#### Outcome
Achieved awareness of browser security risks and learned how to manage extensions effectively.

#### Interview Questions Answered
1. **How can browser extensions pose security risks?**  
   Extensions can access sensitive data (e.g., browsing history, form inputs), inject malicious scripts, or track user activity, potentially leading to data theft or privacy breaches.

2. **What permissions should raise suspicion?**  
   Permissions like "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit" or "Manage your downloads" without a clear need for such access are suspicious.

3. **How to safely install browser extensions?**  
   Install extensions only from trusted sources (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons), review permissions, check user reviews, and verify the developer’s reputation.

4. **What is extension sandboxing?**  
   Sandboxing isolates extensions, limiting their access to the system and other browser components, reducing the risk of harm if the extension is malicious.

5. **Can extensions steal passwords?**  
   Yes, if they have permission to access website data or form inputs, malicious extensions can steal passwords or other sensitive information.

6. **How to update extensions securely?**  
   Enable automatic updates in the browser settings (Chrome: `chrome://extensions/` > toggle "Developer mode" off; Firefox: `about:addons` > ensure auto-updates are on). Manually check for updates regularly.

7. **Difference between extensions and plugins?**  
   Extensions add functionality to the browser (e.g., ad blockers), while plugins enhance web content handling (e.g., Flash, Java). Plugins are mostly obsolete now.

8. **How to report malicious extensions?**  
   - In Chrome: On the extension’s Chrome Web Store page, click "Report abuse."  
   - In Firefox: On the extension’s Add-ons page, click "Report this add-on for abuse."

#### Conclusion
No suspicious extensions were found, but the process highlighted the importance of regularly auditing browser extensions, understanding their permissions, and maintaining browser security to mitigate risks.
