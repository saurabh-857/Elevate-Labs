### Task 6: Creating and Evaluating Strong Passwords

#### Objective
The goal of this task was to understand what makes a password strong, create passwords of varying complexity, test them using an online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com), and summarize the findings to identify best practices for password security.

#### Tools Used
- Online password strength checker: [passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)

#### Process
Following the mini-guide, I completed the task as outlined below:

1. **Created Multiple Passwords with Varying Complexity**  
   I generated four passwords with increasing complexity:  
   - Password 1: `pass123` (simple, lowercase, and numbers)  
   - Password 2: `Pass1234` (added uppercase, slightly longer)  
   - Password 3: `P@ssw0rd!` (added symbols, uppercase, lowercase, and numbers)  
   - Password 4: `Tr0ub4dor&3xplor3r` (longer, mixed characters, no common words)

2. **Used a Variety of Characters**  
   Each password incorporated a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations as recommended.

3. **Tested Each Password on Passwordmeter.com**  
   I evaluated the passwords using passwordmeter.com, which provides a score (out of 100) and feedback on strengths and weaknesses.

4. **Noted Scores and Feedback**  
   - **Password 1: `pass123`**  
     Score: 35% (Weak)  
     Feedback: Too short, lacks uppercase and symbols, uses predictable patterns.  
   - **Password 2: `Pass1234`**  
     Score: 68 (Strong)  
     Feedback: Slightly better with uppercase, but still too short and predictable.  
   - **Password 3: `P@ssw0rd!`**  
     Score: 82% (Very Strong)  
     Feedback: Better with symbols and mixed characters, but "password" is a common word, making it vulnerable.  
   - **Password 4: `Tr0ub4dor&3xplor3r`**  
     Score: 100% (Very Strong)  
     Feedback: Excellent length, diverse characters, no predictable patterns. Minor improvement: avoid repeating characters.

5. **Identified Best Practices for Strong Passwords**  
   - Use at least 12-16 characters.  
   - Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.  
   - Avoid common words (e.g., "password") or predictable patterns (e.g., "1234").  
   - Use random, unique combinations for each account.

6. **Tips Learned from the Evaluation**  
   - Longer passwords significantly improve strength.  
   - Avoid dictionary words, even with substitutions (e.g., "P@ssw0rd" is still Strong, but scores only 68%).  
   - Randomness is keyâ€”use unrelated words or phrases.  
   - Password managers can help generate and store complex passwords securely.

7. **Researched Common Password Attacks**  
   - **Brute Force Attacks**: Hackers systematically try all possible combinations to guess a password. Longer passwords are harder to crack.  
   - **Dictionary Attacks**: Attackers use a list of common words or phrases. Avoid dictionary words to mitigate this risk.

8. **Summary of How Password Complexity Affects Security**  
   Password complexity directly impacts security. Short, predictable passwords (e.g., `pass123`) are easily cracked through brute force or dictionary attacks. Longer, random passwords with diverse characters (e.g., `Tr0ub4dor&3xplor3r`) take exponentially longer to crack, making them far more secure. Complexity also reduces the risk of guessing or phishing attacks.

#### Outcome
Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of password security. The evaluation highlighted the importance of length, randomness, and character diversity in creating strong passwords. I also learned best practices to protect against common attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks, ensuring better online security.

### Answers to Interview Questions

1. **What makes a password strong?**  
   A strong password is long (12-16+ characters), uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and avoids predictable patterns or common words.

2. **What are common password attacks?**  
   Common attacks include brute force (trying all combinations), dictionary attacks (using common word lists), phishing, and keylogging.

3. **Why is password length important?**  
   Longer passwords increase the number of possible combinations, making them harder to crack via brute force attacks.

4. **What is a dictionary attack?**  
   A dictionary attack uses a precompiled list of common words, phrases, or passwords to guess a password.

5. **What is multi-factor authentication?**  
   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) requires two or more verification methods (e.g., password + SMS code) to access an account, adding an extra layer of security.

6. **How do password managers help?**  
   Password managers generate, store, and autofill complex, unique passwords for each account, reducing the risk of reuse or weak passwords.

7. **What are passphrases?**  
   Passphrases are longer passwords made up of multiple words (e.g., `BlueSky$River2025`), which are easier to remember but harder to crack.

8. **What are common mistakes in password creation?**  
   Common mistakes include using short passwords, predictable patterns (e.g., "123"), dictionary words, or reusing passwords across accounts.
